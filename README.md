## Part 1:
• DOMAIN: Electronics and Telecommunication

• CONTEXT: A communications equipment manufacturing company has a product which is responsible for emitting
informative signals. Company wants to build a machine learning model which can help the company to predict the
equipment’s signal quality using various parameters.

• DATA DESCRIPTION: The data set contains information on various signal tests performed:
1. Parameters: Various measurable signal parameters.
2. Signal_Quality: Final signal strength or quality.

• PROJECT OBJECTIVE: The need is to build a regressor which can use these parameters to determine the signal strength or
quality [as number].

## Part 2:
• DOMAIN: Electronics and Telecommunication

• CONTEXT: A communications equipment manufacturing company has a product which is responsible for emitting
informative signals. Company wants to build a deep learning model which can help the company to predict the equipment’s
signal quality using various parameters.

• DATA DESCRIPTION: The data set contains information on various signal tests performed:
1. Parameters: Various measurable signal parameters.
2. Signal_Quality: Final signal strength or quality

• PROJECT OBJECTIVE: The need is to build a classifier which can use these parameters to determine the signal strength or
quality [as number].

## Part 3:
• CONTEXT: Develop a clickable GUI [desk application or web service application] which can automate Part I & II of this
project.

## Part 4:
• DOMAIN: Autonomous Vehicles

• BUSINESS CONTEXT: A Recognising multi-digit numbers in photographs captured at street level is an
important component of modern-day map making. A classic example of a corpus of such street-level
photographs is Google’s Street View imagery composed of hundreds of millions of geo-located 360-degree
panoramic images.
The ability to automatically transcribe an address number from a geo-located patch of pixels and associate the
transcribed number with a known street address helps pinpoint, with a high degree of accuracy, the location of
the building it represents. More broadly, recognising numbers in photographs is a problem of interest to the
optical character recognition community.
While OCR on constrained domains like document processing is well studied, arbitrary multi-character text
recognition in photographs is still highly challenging. This difficulty arises due to the wide variability in the
visual appearance of text in the wild on account of a large range of fonts, colours, styles, orientations, and
character arrangements.
The recognition problem is further complicated by environmental factors such as lighting, shadows,
specularity, and occlusions as well as by image acquisition factors such as resolution, motion, and focus blurs.
In this project, we will use the dataset with images centred around a single digit (many of the images do
contain some distractors at the sides). Although we are taking a sample of the data which is simpler, it is more
complex than MNIST because of the distractors.

• DATA DESCRIPTION: The SVHN is a real-world image dataset for developing machine learning and object
recognition algorithms with the minimal requirement on data formatting but comes from a significantly harder,
unsolved, real-world problem (recognising digits and numbers in natural scene images). SVHN is obtained from
house numbers in Google Street View images.
Where the labels for each of this image are the prominent number in that image i.e. 2,6,7 and 4 respectively.
