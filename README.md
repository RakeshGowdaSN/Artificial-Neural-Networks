## Part 1:
• DOMAIN: Electronics and Telecommunication

• CONTEXT: A communications equipment manufacturing company has a product which is responsible for emitting
informative signals. Company wants to build a machine learning model which can help the company to predict the
equipment’s signal quality using various parameters.

• DATA DESCRIPTION: The data set contains information on various signal tests performed:
1. Parameters: Various measurable signal parameters.
2. Signal_Quality: Final signal strength or quality.

• PROJECT OBJECTIVE: The need is to build a regressor which can use these parameters to determine the signal strength or
quality [as number].

## Part 2:
• DOMAIN: Electronics and Telecommunication

• CONTEXT: A communications equipment manufacturing company has a product which is responsible for emitting
informative signals. Company wants to build a deep learning model which can help the company to predict the equipment’s
signal quality using various parameters.

• DATA DESCRIPTION: The data set contains information on various signal tests performed:
1. Parameters: Various measurable signal parameters.
2. Signal_Quality: Final signal strength or quality

• PROJECT OBJECTIVE: The need is to build a classifier which can use these parameters to determine the signal strength or
quality [as number].
